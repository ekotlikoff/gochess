### Todo
* Observability
    - [ ] Prometheus metrics
        - [ ] more?
    - [ ] Improve logging
* Server
    - http server
      - [ ] If no response from client in x seconds then call disconnect win for opponent
      - [ ] Support some mechanism for a user cancelling their matchmaking
      - [ ] Implement GET /session so that a disconnected client can reconnect
        - On initial page load call /session
        - Server will return the corresponding username (credentials) regardless of if a game is ongoing or not, client will set the username input to that username
        - Server will also check for an ongoing game, if one is ongoing send the game state to the client, client will set the game state accordingly
        - [] handle disconnected client gracefully, let matchserver know on disconnect and it starts a timer, ending game with timeout on alarm
        - [x] redesign clientDoneWithMatch, instead the match signifies when it's over and client servers synchronize on that, resetting themselves.  The other way around required client servers to let the matchserver know when they were done with a match, this made less sense because a client could have disconnected and take some time to reconnect and it's harder to tell when they're done.  Worth noting here that to scale we would likely want to be somewhat aggressive on reeping inactive players in sessionCache, because players could frequently disconnect when losing without formally resigning and letting their client server reset the player object, thus keeping a reference to the match and preventing GC.
      - [ ] Use browser session storage to save the session token cookie, that way a client can refresh and check if their token is still valid/in a game https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage
    - http server sessions
      - [ ] user auth?
* Client
    - [ ] Check cookies for session token instead of using hasSession bool
        - Not sure if possible, the golang cookiejar doesn't seem like it supports this.

### Done
* Observability
    - Prometheus metrics
        - [x] gauge for number of live games
        - [x] gauge for number of players matching
        - [x] counter for request count split by status
        - [x] histogram for latency split by status
    - [x] Centralize logging config into cmd/webserver/main
    - [x] Tracing
        - [x] Example trace
        - [x] Tracing for the websocket flow
* Detect all game end scenarios
    * https://www.chess.com/article/view/how-chess-games-can-end-8-ways-explained#:~:text=Agreement-,Win%2FLose%3A,%3A%20checkmate%2C%20resignation%20and%20timeout.
    - [x] Detect stalemate
    - [x] Handle pawn promotion
    - [x] 50 move rule
    - [x] Insufficient material
    - [x] timeout
    - [x] resignation
    - [x] agreed draw
    - [x] Detect draw by repetition (same position 3 times)
        See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition for the definition
        of position.
        Let's do this with a map[positionId]uint8
        Just need a hash function to go from position -> positionId
        - [x] Clear the state to save memory after an irreversible move (capture, pawn move, castle)
* Server
    - [x] http server
      - [x] Websocket ping + pong messages at certain interval (if no other message written), this lets us have a read and write deadline enabling us to close out the read loops cleanly
      - [x] Make a websocket server/client as an alternative to polling
      - [x] Move ttlmap out to a separate package that can be shared by http and websocket
      - [x] Move web client out of server directory to client directory as it will use both HTTP and websocket server depending on compile flags (or whatever)
        - [x] Restructure the webservers so that we have a front line webserver for auth and static files, and for other requests it proxies to a distinct websocket or http webserver
      - [x] Instead of hanging indefinitely on GET sync/async, return with no update after timeout
      - [x] Instead of hanging indefinitely on GET match, return after a server timeout with http 204
      - [x] checkmate test
      - [x] requested draw test
      - [x] resignation test
      - [x] timeout test
      - [x] GET /sync should also provide player and opponent's remaining time to keep client, server in sync (implemented for WS only)
    - [x] http server sessions
      - [x] testing
    - [x] client agnostic matching server
        - [x] testing
        - [x] if client abandoned set the opponent as the winner
          - [x] websocket
          - [x] engine
    - [x] Max matching time, after which we match the player with a chess engine (if connected)
* Client
    - [x] Golang WebAssembly web client
    - [x] Ensure that webclient can enter matchmaking successfully after a gameover
    - [x] Show "pending draw" when requesting a draw
    - [x] Handle 202 responses from GET match while still pending
    - [x] Handle 200 response from GET sync/async with no update
    - [x] Display matched opponent name
    - [x] Display gameover results
    - [x] Request a draw/resign
    - [x] Display remaining time
    - [x] Display point advantage/captured pieces
    - [x] Play local match vs begin matchmaking
    - [x] Mobile support
* General
    - [x] Travis CI test
    - [x] Fix race conditions
    - [x] Add race testing to travis CI
    - [x] Add vet to local build with https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/Makefile as inspiration
    - [x] Support pieceType options for pawn promotion
